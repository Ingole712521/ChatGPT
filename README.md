## Introduction

ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art language model designed to generate human-like text based on the input it receives. This project utilizes the GPT-3.5 variant to create a chatbot that can hold interactive and dynamic conversations with users. The chatbot is built to handle a wide range of topics and can be integrated into various applications such as customer support, content generation, and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with the ChatGPT project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/Ingole712521/ChatGPT.git`
2. Install the required dependencies by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Obtain your GPT-3.5 API key from OpenAI and replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` in the code with your actual API key.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
/
|-- chatbot.py           # Main chatbot application
|-- config.py            # Configuration settings
|-- utils.py             # Utility functions
